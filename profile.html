    	    	<p class="bio">Video games have always been an important part of my life. The intricate story and detail have always captivated me. For the past few years of my life, I've started to realize how games that I know and love were made. The level of detail and creativity that developers incorporate into their games inspire me to do the same. <br></p>

    	    	<p class="bio">For about four years, I've been learning how to develop, program, and task/resource manage projects involving game creating and designing. I started developing in GameMaker: Studio using 2D assets. I grew a basic understanding of proper workflow and procedure as I led a small team of 4 on a personal project. We were able to create a twenty-minute demo of a pixelated-RPG game with a working inventory system and real-time combat. As I started to get more involved with work, our team slowly faded and I realized that game developing was a dream that I wanted to pursue full-time. <br></p>

    	    	<p class="bio">In 2017, I was accepted into the <span class="bold">Northern Alberta Institute of Technology</span> as a student in the Digital Media and IT program. I started focusing my studies in the Game Programming stream. Under <span class="bold"><a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/john-winski-6063a84" target="_blank">John Winski</a></span>'s instruction, he tested my skills against a multitude of challenging projects. I've since been sharpening my programming skills and I will be graduating and receiving my diploma for Game Programming as of Summer 2019. <br></p>

    	    	<p class="bio">So far, I've learned how to efficiently program in <span class="bold">C#</span> and focus my development in the <span class="bold">Unity Engine</span>. The engines that I've also used to create games involve GameMaker: Studio and Monogame. </p>

    	    	<p class="bio">Hereafter, I aim to study and hone my craft to develop and inspire new ideas and innovations involving game creating.</p>
