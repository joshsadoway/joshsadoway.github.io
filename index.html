                	<p>This project was started in college where we had to demonstrate our knowledge of static objects and use a singleton method to keep values while going between different scenes. I decided that I wanted to also test my skills against programmable animations and use tools to create terrain through multiple meshes, as well as bake ambient lighting.</p>

        			<h2>Super Knuckles Bros. (2018)</h2>
                	<p>As I really like to revisualize some of my favourite older games, I started this one with a slight twist. Back in 2018 was a blown up meme which was called "Uganda Knuckles" of course stemming from a special, red Sonic the Hedgehog character. This meme had inspired all of my college projects to feature Uganda Knuckles that semester. My most favoured project was our final. We were to make any game we wanted. 
                	</p>
                	<p>This glorious monstrosity was created with wonky physics and features the first level of the original Super Mario Bros. Of course, with an alternative playable character that we all love.</p>

                	<p>BitWars has been my first dive into making games for touch screen devices. It started off as a match-three game to a match-three RPG turn-based game. The code, assets, and other implementations were conceptualized in a day and we hope to further expand and develop this project into a full-fledged anroid game. We hope to publish it to the Google Play Store in the near future.</p>

        			<p>This project was the result of an upset girlfriend. Unfortunately after switching from an iOS to an android device, she wasn't able to download her favorite Christmas application which counts down the time until the upcoming Christmas. After using System.DateTime methods, I was able to replicate her favorite app and make her smile. I call that a win-win!</p>

                	<p>After the 2018 Christmas break, my class recieved our first lab. We were to use a binary or XML serializer to save a load data into our game. I particularly liked the concept of a racing game. The goal of the game is to race through all of the objectives in the game, then race to the finish line. I implemented saving a loading profiles that had an associated name, current highest time, type of vehicle, and vehicle color. The race is on!</p>
